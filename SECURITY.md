## Reporting a Vulnerability

The rottingresearch project takes security seriously.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the **Security Vulnerability Report** issue template.

This ensures we receive all necessary information to assess and address the issue quickly.

## Responsible Disclosure

|------|------------|
| Low | Minor issue, no direct data exposure |
| Medium | Limited impact under specific conditions |
| High | Significant impact such as data exposure or auth bypass |
| Critical | Remote exploitation or system compromise |

## Response Expectations

Maintainers aim to:
- Acknowledge reports within **72 hours**
- Provide updates as mitigation progresses
- Credit reporters when appropriate

Thank you for helping keep rottingresearch secure.
