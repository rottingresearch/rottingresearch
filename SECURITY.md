## Reporting a Vulnerability

The rottingresearch project takes security seriously.

To report a security vulnerability, please use one of the following methods:

- For sensitive or not-yet-disclosed vulnerabilities, please submit a private report via **GitHub Security Advisories** (Security → Report a vulnerability) so details are not publicly visible.
- For low-risk issues or hardening suggestions that are safe to discuss publicly, you may use the **Security Vulnerability Report** issue template:
  ➡️ GitHub → New Issue → 🔐 Security Vulnerability Report

Using these channels ensures we receive all necessary information to assess and address issues quickly while avoiding premature public disclosure.

## Responsible Disclosure

- Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before maintainers have reviewed them.
- For critical issues, maintainers may request private coordination before public discussion.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description |
|------|------------|
| Low | Minor issue, no direct data exposure |
| Medium | Limited impact under specific conditions |
| High | Significant impact such as data exposure or auth bypass |
| Critical | Remote exploitation or system compromise |

## Response Expectations

Maintainers aim to:
- Acknowledge reports within **72 hours**
- Provide updates as mitigation progresses
- Credit reporters when appropriate

Thank you for helping keep rottingresearch secure.
